# Shoppie

Shoppie is an ecommerce software that can be used to track the proces of products online and then send alerts to user when a certain price limit has been reached. Shoppie is built using React and TypeScript for the front end and Node.js, Express and JavaScript for the backend. MySQL has been used for database management and axios and puppeteer libraries have been leveraged for API formation and web scraping, respectively.

The development of Shoppie serves two purposes:

1) To serve as a key project where I can develop and showcase my full stack software capabilities to prospective employers. 
2) To attempt and find potential market fit for this product and find some commerical value.

As such, Shoppie is not primarily an open source project to be shared and collaborated on. Some aspects of the code are omitted from this repository and instructions on installing and hosting the project aren't provided.
